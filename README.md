===================

Building a blog from scratch;  front to back.

This is a blog written by Gavin Shriver for a friend. It has several immediate purposes.
	A) To provide a friend (who wishes to remain nameless) a place to post his wonderful writings/commentaries under a pen name.
	B) To build a blog entirely from front to back.
	C) To be a small demonstration of coding capablities.

And one less immediate purpose:
	D) To build an application scalable for others to [potentially] post friends' writings under aliases 
		[If this becomes a thing... more on it later!]
